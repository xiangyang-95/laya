Laya evaluates typed questions (`choice`, `score`, `noul`) over any state (text, email, ticket or JSON document) in **a single forward pass** — 33 ms for one question, 7.2 ms/question batched, measured on a T4. No text generation, so nothing to parse and nothing to hallucinate.

Three checkpoints, and a `Router` that picks between them per request:

| | encoder | params | context | use it for |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`laya`](https://huggingface.co/convaiinnovations/laya) | ModernBERT-large | 421M | 512 | English |
| [`laya-multilingual`](https://huggingface.co/convaiinnovations/laya-multilingual) | mmBERT-base | 322M | 1024 | 100+ languages, 2x faster |
| [`laya-typed-decisions`](https://huggingface.co/convaiinnovations/laya-typed-decisions) | ModernBERT-large | 421M | 1024 | the typed-decisions workflows |

### What's new in 0.3.7

* **About 10x faster loading.** Checkpoints are built without the throwaway random weight initialisation, so `laya.load()` drops from about 22 s to about 2 s on CPU with bit-identical answers. This also skips the pass that crashed on Windows with Python 3.14 (#123).
* **Better routing for non-English Latin text.** Plain-ASCII Spanish, Italian, Portuguese and French (accents stripped by mail clients and ticket systems) and Brazilian Portuguese support text now reach the multilingual checkpoint. Letters in scripts the router has no range for no longer fall through to English, and URLs, e-mail addresses and dotted names no longer count as words. Checked on 20,000 English texts, with no English prose moved.
* **A Jev-compatible HTTP server.** `pip install "laya[serve]"`, then `laya-serve`, speaks `POST /v1/systemone`, so existing TypeSafe clients work by changing `baseUrl`. See [Self-Hosting](#self-hosting-http-server-jev-compatible).
* **Router defaults and hooks.** `Router()` keeps two checkpoints resident, so alternating languages no longer reload a model on every request. You can pass your own language guess with `lang_guess=` and send undecided text to `Router(default=...)`. `Router` and `Agent` also work as context managers, and evicted models free their memory.
* **Clearer errors and safer edge cases.** A malformed question is rejected with a message naming the question and what to fix. An empty question set returns an empty answer, and invalid temperatures in a checkpoint no longer stop it loading.
* **E-mail cleaning for Portuguese and Spanish** replies, signatures and footers.
* **Fine-tuning notebook fixes.** Calibration is now fitted on a held-out slice rather than on training data (#186), and stale temperature overrides are cleared before a refit.
* **Docker quickstart** under `docs/docker.md`.

## Installation

Python 3.10 or newer. The dependencies set that floor: `huggingface_hub` 1.x, `transformers` 5.x and `torch` 2.14 all require 3.10.

**Optional PyTorch build selection:** If you need a CPU-only or GPU-specific PyTorch build, follow [PyTorch's installation guide](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) after creating your virtual environment and before installing Laya. Replace `pip` or `pip3` in the selected command with the environment's Python executable followed by `-m pip`.

If you already use a virtual environment, install the PyPI release with:

```bash
python -m pip install laya
```

For a new environment, choose the commands for your platform below. Run them from your project directory; the explicit Python paths keep installation and verification in the same environment.

**macOS / Linux** (with Python 3.10 or newer):

On Debian/Ubuntu, the system Python may require `sudo apt install python3-venv` before creating a virtual environment. If `venv` reports that `ensurepip` is unavailable, install that package and retry.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install laya
.venv/bin/python -I -c "import laya; print(laya.__version__)"
```

**Windows PowerShell** (this example uses an installed Python 3.11):

```powershell
py -3.11 -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install laya
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -I -c "import laya; print(laya.__version__)"
```

**Intel GPU (XPU)**

Install a supported Intel GPU driver first. For an XPU-enabled PyTorch build, install its wheel before Laya; the default PyPI wheel may be CPU-only. PyTorch's validated hardware and OS list is in the [Intel GPU guide](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/2.14/notes/get_start_xpu.html).

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/xpu
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install laya
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -c "import torch; print(torch.xpu.is_available())"
```

For a source checkout, replace `pip install laya` with `pip install -e .`. Laya automatically selects an available XPU when no device is specified; you can also request one explicitly with `device="xpu"` in `laya.load()` or `Router(device="xpu")`.

**Install from GitHub**

To use the development version instead of the PyPI release, create the virtual environment above and replace its installation command with the appropriate command below. Git must be installed.

```bash
# macOS / Linux
.venv/bin/python -m pip install "git+https://github.com/NandhaKishorM/laya.git"
```

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install "git+https://github.com/NandhaKishorM/laya.git"
```

Run the same version check afterward. The GitHub version follows the repository's default branch and may differ from the published release.

**Model setup and troubleshooting**

Continue with the [Router quickstart](#quickstart-route-mode-recommended) to run inference. Loading a Hub checkpoint requires access to Hugging Face on its first download; the quickstart's `Router(preload=True)` loads all three configured checkpoints at construction.

- **`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'laya'`:** run both installation and your script with the same virtual environment's Python executable shown above. In an editor, select that interpreter as well.
- **Missing `rl_agent_config.json`:** this file ships with a Laya checkpoint alongside `model.safetensors`; it is not a configuration file you need to create in the source repository. For a local model, pass the directory containing those checkpoint files.

---

## Hosted API

If you would rather not run a GPU, [impossibl](https://impossibl.com) serves Laya on a hosted
endpoint, **free**, wire-compatible with TypeSafe's System One API — so a client written
against Jev moves over by changing the base URL and the model id, and nothing else.

```bash
curl https://api.impossibl.com/v1/systemone \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $IMPOSSIBL_API_KEY" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "model": "convaiinnovations/laya",
    "state": "Hi, we were billed twice for March. Refund the duplicate today or we cancel.",
    "questions": {
      "churn_risk": { "type": "noul", "instructions": "Is this customer likely to churn?" }
    }
  }'
```

| model id | checkpoint |
|---|---|
| `convaiinnovations/laya` | whichever the `Router` picks, same as `Router(preload=True)` |
| `convaiinnovations/laya-multilingual` | pins `laya-multilingual`, whatever the script |

The second id exists because routing is by script: Latin-script text is answered by the
English checkpoint, so Spanish or Portuguese never reaches the multilingual weights on its
own. Both ids run the checkpoints published here, unmodified, at `max_len` 8192.

## Quickstart: Route Mode (Recommended)

To try the Python SDK in a CPU container, see the
[Docker Compose quickstart](docs/docker.md). It runs a sample request and keeps
downloaded models between runs.

Laya ships three checkpoints. The built-in **`Router`** is the recommended entry point: it evaluates any state in any language, automatically detects scripts and languages in sub-milliseconds, and dispatches to the optimal checkpoint in a single forward pass.

```python
from laya import Router

# Preload checkpoints into memory for instant sub-35ms routing
router = Router(preload=True)

# 1. State in any language or schema
state = {
    "from": "user@acme.com",
    "subject": "Duplicate charge on invoice #4411",
    "body": "Hi, we were billed twice for March. Please refund the duplicate today or we will cancel our plan."
}

# 2. Define your typed questions
questions = {
    "department": {
        "type": "choice",
        "instructions": "Which department should handle this request?",
        "criteria": {
            "billing": "invoices, payments, refunds",
            "technical": "bugs, outages, system errors",
            "sales": "pricing, new contracts",
            "other": "everything else"
        }
    },
    "urgency": {
        "type": "score",
        "instructions": "How urgent is this request?",
        "criteria": ["not urgent", "soon", "critical deadline or blocking issue"]
    },
    "churn_risk": {
        "type": "noul",
        "instructions": "Does the user threaten to cancel or leave?"
    },
    "refund_requested": {
        "type": "noul",
        "instructions": "Does the user explicitly request a refund?"
    }
}

# 3. English state -> automatically routed to laya (ModernBERT-large, 39.5 ms)
res_en = router.predict(state, questions)
print("Department :", res_en["answers"]["department"]["choice"])  # -> billing (confidence: 0.94)
print("Routing    :", res_en["routing"]["model"])                 # -> english

# 4. Hindi state -> automatically routed to laya-multilingual (mmBERT-base, 32.8 ms)
res_hi = router.predict({"body": "मुझसे दो बार शुल्क लिया गया, कृपया पैसे वापस करें।"}, questions)
print("Department :", res_hi["answers"]["department"]["choice"])  # -> billing (confidence: 0.86)
print("Routing    :", res_hi["routing"]["model"])                 # -> multilingual

# 5. Explicit override when you want a specific checkpoint
res_td = router.predict(state, questions, model="typed-decisions")
```

Every result carries full routing metadata explaining why the choice was made:

```python
res_hi["routing"]
# {
#   'model': 'multilingual',
#   'repo': 'convaiinnovations/laya/multilingual',
#   'reason': 'non-Latin script (devanagari, 100% of letters); the English checkpoint cannot read it'
# }
```

Inspect a routing decision without running any forward pass:

```python
router.route({"body": "Der Kunde wurde zweimal belastet"}, questions).reason
# "Latin script but language looks like 'de', not English"
```

Very short Latin-script text often carries nothing that identifies its language (`"Quero cancelar"`, `"Esqueci minha senha"`). Such text goes to `default`, which is `"english"` unless you change it. If most of your traffic is not English, set:

```python
router = Router(default="multilingual")
router.route({"body": "Esqueci minha senha"}).model                 # -> multilingual
router.route({"body": "Please refund the duplicate charge"}).model  # -> english
```

### Why Route: The Evidence

On a shared benchmark (17,416 questions, one T4 GPU, identical questions per model):

| Benchmark / Task | English (`laya`) | Multilingual (`laya-multilingual`) | `Router` (Routed) |
|---|---|---|---|
| MASSIVE intent, English | **0.783** | 0.657 | **0.783** |
| MASSIVE intent, 13 other languages | 0.306 | **0.451** | **0.451** |
| XNLI, English | **0.860** | 0.843 | **0.860** |
| XNLI, 14 other languages | 0.521 | **0.731** | **0.731** |
| Languages usable (>3x random) | 23 / 51 | 45 / 51 | **45 / 51** |
| Latency, 1 question (T4 GPU) | 39.5 ms | **32.8 ms** | **32.8 ms** |
| Latency, 10 questions batched | 158.6 ms | **72.3 ms** | **72.3 ms** |

The English checkpoint collapses on non-Latin scripts (Khmer scores **0.000 accuracy at 0.952 confidence**). Because the model stays confident while being wrong, confidence gating cannot save you. `Router` detects the script in <0.5 ms pure Python before the forward pass.

### Production Preload & Memory

A cold checkpoint build costs seconds; language detection costs microseconds. The lazy default keeps **two** checkpoints resident — `english` and `multilingual`, the only two automatic routing chooses between — so a language flip costs detection only once each has been built. `max_loaded=1` rebuilds the checkpoint it just evicted on *every* switch (measured at a 7.4 s median reload on CPU and 10.3 s on T4), and traffic that only ever sees one language never builds the second, so the default costs a single-language deployment nothing.

For a server or production app, preload:

```python
# Every checkpoint resident in memory; language flips cost detection only (<1 ms)
router = Router(preload=True)
router = Router(preload=True, device="cuda")

# Or preload only the specific checkpoints you serve:
router.preload(["english", "multilingual"])

# If your app already built an agent, attach it to avoid duplicate VRAM:
router.attach("english", existing_agent)

# Manage resident memory (default keeps two hot: english + multilingual, LRU eviction)
router = Router(max_loaded=3)       # keep all three hot, e.g. with auto_task_detection
router = Router(max_loaded=1)       # memory-constrained host, reloads on every switch
router.unload()                     # free memory
```

| Deployment Mode | Per-Request Latency | Model Reloads |
|---|---|---|
| `Router()` (lazy, `max_loaded=2`) | detection only (<1 ms) on a switch, after each language's first load | 1 the first time a language appears |
| `Router(max_loaded=1)` | 7 to 10 s on every language switch | 1 per switch |
| `Router(preload=True)` | **32.8 ms (GPU) / 193–464 ms (CPU)** | **none** |

### Supplying Your Own Language Detection

Routing asks one question: *can the English checkpoint read this state?* The built-in detector answers it from the script and a function-word heuristic, and is deliberately dependency-free. That heuristic is best-effort on Latin-script languages it holds no word list for, so a short request can carry no usable signal:

```python
from laya.lang import analyse
analyse("Care este ora in Tokyo?")
# {'script': 'latin', 'language': 'en', 'is_english': True}   -> the English checkpoint
```

If you already run a language-identification model, hand routing the answer instead of relying on the heuristic. `lang_guess` takes a language code or a callable receiving the state, and is checked after an explicit `lang=` and before detection:

```python
# A code you already know
router.predict(state, questions, lang_guess="ro")

# A callable, e.g. wrapping fastText, CLD3 or a transformer LID
router.predict(state, questions, lang_guess=lambda s: my_lid(s))

# Or install one for every request on a server
router = Router(preload=True, lang_guess=my_lid)
```

The hint only decides *English or not*: a code whose primary subtag is `en`, `eng` or `english` routes to the English checkpoint and everything else routes to the multilingual one. `"en_US"` and `"en_US.UTF-8"` are read as English, so `$LANG` can be passed straight through. Returning `None`, or an empty code, makes it abstain and the built-in detector decides as before — so a LID model that is unsure does not force a checkpoint. An explicit `model=`, `task=` or `lang=` still wins, and the default path is unchanged.

---

## Self-Hosting: HTTP Server (Jev-compatible)

`laya.serve` exposes the `Router` over HTTP on the same `POST /v1/systemone`
wire protocol as TypeSafe's hosted Jev API. Laya's answer payload is already
schema-identical to what Jev returns (`choice`/`score`/`noul` answers and a
`{input_tokens, output_tokens}` usage block), so an existing Jev client — e.g.
the [`hs-jev`](https://github.com/getmissionctrl/hs-jev) Haskell client — just
needs its `baseUrl` repointed; nothing else changes.

```bash
pip install "laya[serve]"          # adds fastapi + uvicorn
LAYA_DEVICE=cuda LAYA_PRELOAD=1 laya-serve   # binds 0.0.0.0:8000, preloads all 3 checkpoints
```

```bash
curl -s localhost:8000/v1/systemone -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{
  "state": {"body": "billed twice, refund please or we cancel"},
  "questions": {"dept": {"type": "choice", "instructions": "which team?",
                "criteria": {"billing": "refunds", "tech": "bugs"}}}
}'
```

Configuration is by environment variable: `LAYA_HOST`, `LAYA_PORT`,
`LAYA_DEVICE`, `LAYA_PRELOAD`, `LAYA_MODELS` (comma list to preload),
`LAYA_THREADS` (cap torch intra-op threads for CPU inference — keep at or below
physical cores), `LAYA_AUTO_TASK`, and `LAYA_API_KEY` (when set, clients must
send `Authorization: Bearer <key>`). A client's `model` field is honoured when it
names a Laya checkpoint (`english`/`multilingual`/`typed-decisions`), otherwise
the router auto-selects by script/language.

### Nix / NixOS

This repo is a flake. On a machine with an NVIDIA GPU:

```bash
nix run .#laya-serve          # build (prebuilt CUDA torch, no compile) and serve
nix develop                   # dev shell: torch-bin, transformers, fastapi, pytest
```

For a NixOS host, import the module and enable the service:

```nix
# flake inputs:  laya.url = "github:<you>/laya";  # or path:/… on the same host
{
  imports = [ laya.nixosModules.default ];
  services.laya-serve = {
    enable = true;
    host = "0.0.0.0";           # or bind to the Tailscale/LAN address
    openFirewall = true;
    device = "cuda";
    models = [ "english" "multilingual" "typed-decisions" ];
    # apiKeyFile = config.age.secrets.laya-api-key.path;  # optional bearer auth
  };
}
```

The module runs a hardened `DynamicUser` systemd unit with CUDA device access,
caches weights under `/var/lib/laya-serve`, and reads the bearer token (if any)
via `LoadCredential` so it never enters the store.

---

## Single-Model Mode (Direct SDK)

If you only need a single checkpoint for a dedicated pipeline, you can load models directly:

```python
import laya

# 1. Load a specific checkpoint directly from the hub
agent = laya.load("convaiinnovations/laya")                           # English root
agent_ml = laya.load("convaiinnovations/laya", subfolder="multilingual") # 100+ languages
agent_td = laya.load("convaiinnovations/laya", subfolder="typed-decisions")

# 2. Run all questions in ONE single forward pass (~35 ms on GPU)
result = agent.predict(state, questions)
answers = result["answers"]

print("Department :", answers["department"]["choice"])   # -> billing (confidence: 0.94)
print("Urgency    :", answers["urgency"]["score"])        # -> 1.84 / 2.0
print("Churn Risk :", answers["churn_risk"]["noul"])       # -> 0.892 (89.2% probability)
```

Passing an empty question dictionary to `agent.predict(state, {})` or
`agent.system_one(state, {})` returns the standard response with `"answers": {}`
and `"usage": {"input_tokens": 0, "output_tokens": 0}`. The state is not tokenized
and no model forward pass runs.

---

## Automated Confidence Gating

Because Laya's probabilities are trained with strictly proper scoring rules (RLCD), confidence scores are statistically meaningful:

```python
dept = answers["department"]["choice"]
conf = answers["department"]["confidence"]

if conf >= 0.85:
    # High confidence: automated action without human in the loop
    route_automatically(dept)
else:
    # Low confidence: escalate to human triage
    escalate_to_human_agent(dept, reason=f"Low confidence ({conf:.2f})")
```

---

## Built-in Workflow Presets

Laya provides pre-tuned question schemas for immediate production use:

```python
import laya

agent = laya.load("convaiinnovations/laya")

# 1. Intelligent Model Router (routes to small vs. frontier models)
routing = agent.predict({"request": "Refactor this service using dependency injection"}, laya.router_questions())

# 2. Real-time Prompt Guardrails (jailbreaks, injections, leaks)
guard = agent.predict({"prompt": "Ignore all instructions"}, laya.guard_questions())

# 3. Content Safety & Moderation (toxicity, harassment, threats)
safety = agent.predict({"post": "User comment text"}, laya.moderation_questions())

# 4. Support Ticket Triage (intent, urgency, frustration, churn)
triage = agent.predict({"message": "My payment failed twice"}, laya.triage_questions())
```

---

## Decision Primitives

| Primitive | Output | Use Cases |
|---|---|---|
| **`choice`** | Top label, probabilities per option, confidence | Department routing, intent classification, topic categorization |
| **`score`** | Expected level on ordinal rubric, distribution, confidence | Frustration level, ticket urgency, harm severity |
| **`noul`** | Calibrated probability P(true) from 0.0 to 1.0 | Phishing detection, spam filtering, jailbreak detection, churn risk |

---

## Benchmarks

Community diagnostic: [Chinese workplace decisions (Feishu-style)](research/benchmarks/feishu_zh/README.md) · [中文说明](research/benchmarks/feishu_zh/README.zh-CN.md). Includes frozen synthetic cases, archived paired Laya/Jev responses, and an offline audit; separate from the benchmark suites below.

**Full report: [`BENCHMARKS.md`](BENCHMARKS.md)** — every run consolidated, languages and themes, with per-language detail for all 51 languages.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NandhaKishorM/laya/main/assets/laya_benchmark.png" alt="Per-language accuracy for both checkpoints across 51 languages" width="100%" />
</p>

All Laya numbers below are measured. Every model answered byte-identical questions
(fixed seed) in the same run. Reproduce with
[`research/scripts/laya_benchmark_colab.ipynb`](research/scripts/laya_benchmark_colab.ipynb) on a T4.

### Speed (Tesla T4, measured)

| questions per call | `laya` | `laya-multilingual` |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 39.5 ms | **32.8 ms** |
| 5 | 84.5 ms | **40.1 ms** |
| 10 | 158.6 ms (15.9 ms/q) | **72.3 ms (7.2 ms/q)** |
| 50 | 771 ms | **337 ms (6.8 ms/q)** |

Batched throughput reaches 103-332 questions/sec on a single T4. For reference, TypeSafe Jev
has been independently measured at 236-276 ms p50
([AbdelStark](https://github.com/AbdelStark/jev-benchmarks),
[nibzard](https://github.com/nibzard/decision-model-benchmark)) -- Laya answers a single
question roughly **6-7x faster**.

### Laya (with routing) vs Jev

Every Laya figure is what `Router().predict(...)` actually returns — the checkpoint the router
selects for that input, not a hand-picked best of three. Jev figures are **third-party
published, never measured here** (no TypeSafe API access), so sample sizes and prompts differ.

| | Jev 1.13.0 | Laya (routed) | |
|---|---|---|---|
| typed-decisions, 2,000 decisions | 0.727 | **0.766** | +0.039 |
| AG News, 4 labels | 0.910 | **0.950** | +0.040 |
| DAIR Emotion, 6 labels | 0.480 | **0.595** | +0.115 |
| Banking77 (72 vs 77 labels) | **0.870** | 0.425 | Jev leads on >20 options |
| ECE *(lower better)* | 0.246 | **0.081** | 3× better (post-temperature) |
| p50 latency, 1 question | 236–276 ms | **32.8 ms** | 7.8× faster |
| Languages usable | *no published benchmark* | **45 of 51** | — |
| Weights | closed API | **Apache 2.0** | — |
| Cost | $0.042 / 1M tokens | **$0 self-hosted** | — |

On DAIR Emotion, Jev assigned **zero probability to the true label on 16% of examples** — a hard
failure for anything branching on confidence.

#### Where Jev leads

* **High-cardinality label spaces (>20 options at default settings):** On Banking77, Jev scores 0.870 (on 72 labels) while Laya scores 0.425 (on 77 labels at default 256-token head budget). This is an architectural token-budget constraint: options share a fixed `head_max_len` budget (192 tokens on English, 256 on multilingual), so 77 options receive only ~3 to 4 tokens per label, causing text to become indistinguishable. Jev supports up to 255 options out-of-the-box. While `laya-multilingual` supports 1,024 context (and up to 8,192 in the encoder) and you can raise `agent.cfg["head_max_len"] = 512` at runtime, Jev is currently better suited for 50+ options in a single prompt without tuning. `predict_shortlist` (see [Honest limits](#honest-limits)) keeps the top `k` labels with a caller-supplied embedding, then runs one forward pass on that shortlist.
* **Soft distribution matching:** On typed-decisions, while Laya achieves higher argmax accuracy (0.766 vs 0.727), Jev achieves higher soft accuracy (0.580 vs 0.471) against the teacher's full probability distributions.
* **Out-of-the-box raw calibration:** Before temperature scaling, the base checkpoint has higher raw ECE (0.213 vs 0.144). Laya achieves its 0.081 ECE after domain temperature fitting.

### typed-decisions, measured on all three checkpoints

400 cases, 2,000 decisions, four workflows.

| model | accuracy | soft acc | Brier | ECE | score MAE |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **`laya-typed-decisions`** | **0.766** | 0.471 | **0.062** | 0.213 | **0.242** |
| `laya` | 0.362 | 0.332 | 0.316 | 0.175 | 0.694 |
| `laya-multilingual` | 0.342 | 0.326 | 0.439 | 0.285 | 0.687 |
| *Jev 1.13.0 (published)* | *0.727* | *0.580* | *0.148* | *0.144* | *0.391* |
| *teacher self-agreement ceiling* | *0.735* | | | | |
| *per-question majority class* | *0.461* | | | | |
| *random guess* | *0.318* | | | | |

The fine-tuned checkpoint beats Jev by 3.9 points and clears the teacher ceiling, with 2.4x
better Brier and 1.6x better score MAE. It wins on all four workflows: invoice processing
0.804, security incidents 0.766, customer service 0.764, agent-trace observability 0.730.
By primitive: `noul` 0.857, `choice` 0.733, `score` 0.723.

Two places it still trails Jev: **soft accuracy** (0.471 vs 0.580 — its argmax is better but
its distributions match the teacher less well) and **ECE** (0.213 vs 0.144), which temperature
fitting addresses.

**The base checkpoints sit below the majority-class baseline** (0.362 and 0.342 against 0.461).
All of the capability on this benchmark comes from fine-tuning.

### Multilingual (51 languages, MASSIVE intent, 20 options, random = 0.050)

| | `laya` | `laya-multilingual` |
|---|---|---|
| English | **0.783** | 0.657 |
| 13 other languages | 0.306 | **0.451** |
| XNLI, English | **0.860** | 0.843 |
| XNLI, 14 other languages | 0.521 | **0.731** |

Across all 51 languages the English checkpoint macro-averages **0.227** with macro ECE
**0.733**, and only 23 of 51 languages clear 3x random. Khmer scores **0.000 at 95.2%
confidence**. This is why [`Router`](#model-routing-three-checkpoints-one-call) exists: the
model's own confidence gives no warning, so the routing decision has to be made before the
forward pass.

### English tasks

| task | `laya` | `laya-multilingual` | note |
|---|---|---|---|
| AG News | **0.947** | 0.937 | in training mix |
| BoolQ | **0.830** | 0.787 | in training mix |
| DAIR Emotion | **0.573** | 0.513 | held out |
| prompt-injections | **0.698** | 0.578 | held out, n=116 |
| SST-5 (ordinal) | 0.372 | 0.282 | held out |

### Calibration

Both checkpoints are over-confident as shipped. Refitting one temperature per (question type,
option count) on held-out data moves mean ECE **0.466 -> 0.081** (`laya`) and
**0.314 -> 0.106** (`laya-multilingual`). `laya-multilingual` ships with no fitted
temperatures at all, so fit them before relying on its probabilities.

At checkpoint load, numeric temperature entries are clamped to `[0.5, 5.0]`; invalid or
non-finite entries use the neutral fallback `1.0`. A runtime warning reports the affected
entries and applied values. Bucket-specific temperatures still take precedence over per-type
values, including when a bucket uses the fallback. Raw values remain available in
`agent.temperature_raw` and `agent.temperature_by_options_raw`. A fallback prevents a loading
failure; it does not establish calibrated confidence.

### Honest limits

* **The base checkpoints are near chance on typed-decisions zero-shot** -- 0.362 and 0.352
  against a 0.318 random baseline and a 0.461 majority-class baseline. The 0.766 figure comes
  from the checkpoint fine-tuned on that benchmark's own training split. Laya is a fast base to
  specialise, not a zero-shot decision engine.
* **High-cardinality choice questions and token budgets:** Sequences split into an option prompt budget (`head_max_len`) and the remaining document/state budget (`max_len - head_max_len`):
  * `laya` (English) defaults to 512 context (`head_max_len = 192`, ~320 tokens for state).
  * `laya-multilingual` and `laya-typed-decisions` default to 1,024 context (`head_max_len = 256`, ~768 tokens for state; mmBERT-base encoder supports up to 8,192 with RoPE).
  At default settings, a 77-option question like Banking77 allocates only `(256 - 16) // 77` ≈ 3–4 tokens per label, which causes accuracy to fall off sharply (0.425 vs Jev's 0.870). If evaluating 50+ options in a single question:
  1. Raise `agent.cfg["head_max_len"] = 512` and `agent.cfg["max_len"] = 1024` (or up to 2048 / 4096 / 8192) so every option has enough tokens to remain distinct.
  2. Or shortlist with embeddings and run one forward pass on the top `k` labels (`predict_shortlist`, example below). `predict` and `system_one` still score every criterion they are given.
  3. Or split the label set yourself into a coarse question and a fine question.

```python
import laya

questions = {
    "intent": {
        "type": "choice",
        "instructions": "Which banking intent is this?",
        "criteria": {
            "card_arrival": "where is my card",
            "transfer_fee": "fee charged on a transfer",
            # ...the rest of a large label set
        },
    }
}
result = laya.predict_shortlist(
    agent,
    {"text": "I was charged twice for a transfer"},
    questions,
    embed_fn=laya.embed_fn_from_agent(agent),  # or any callable: texts -> (n, dim)
    k=20,
)
result["shortlist"]["intent"]["labels"]  # the top 20 labels sent to the model
```

`embed_fn(texts)` returns one vector per string. `embed_fn_from_agent` mean-pools the encoder already loaded on the agent; the decision head runs in the following `predict` / `system_one` call. Probabilities on a shortlisted choice are over those `k` labels. When `k` is at least the number of labels, the original question is passed through and `embed_fn` is not called.

[Issue #102](https://github.com/NandhaKishorM/laya/issues/102) reports that a top-20 zero-shot shortlist moved a BANKING77 run from 54.3% to 60.8% on the reporter's setup. Those figures are the reporter's; this repository has not remeasured them.

* Ordinal `score` questions are the weakest primitive (SST-5 0.372).
* **`noul` can follow its option labels instead of the state, most strongly on `laya` (English).** `noul` renders its two options as `false:` / `true:`, and on the English checkpoint that label pair can dominate the answer, returning a confident "no" for clearly positive input (#156). Until a retrained checkpoint lands, check `noul` answers on your own data. If they look stuck, ask the same question as a two-option `choice` with neutral keys and your yes/no wording as the descriptions:

  ```python
  {"type": "choice", "instructions": "Is this review positive?",
   "criteria": {"A": "yes, the review is positive", "B": "no, the review is negative"}}
  ```
* **`laya-multilingual` has a position bias on `score` questions** (#131): it rarely picks the first-listed level, in any language. For English score questions, route to `model="english"`, and for other languages validate score outputs on your own data before relying on them.
* **`action.act_probability` carries no usable signal yet** (#185). It reads 1.0 for almost every input, and its raw logits run against correctness (AUROC 0.30 on 396 labelled decisions). Gate on `confidence` instead, which reaches an AUROC of 0.77 on the same items.
* `laya` collapses outside English; `laya-multilingual` is weaker on English. Route, or pick
  deliberately.

## Fine-Tuning

Fine-tune Laya on your own domain data. The notebook runs on Kaggle's free 2xT4 GPUs and does
the whole loop: build the dataset, train with RLCD (proper-scoring-rule rewards, GRPO-style
policy gradient), fit calibration temperatures, evaluate, and push the result to the Hub.

* **[`notebooks/laya_finetune_typed_decisions_2xT4_kaggle.ipynb`](notebooks/laya_finetune_typed_decisions_2xT4_kaggle.ipynb)**

The notebook fits one `temperature` per type (`choice`, `score`, `noul`) and removes inherited
`temperature_by_options` from the exported config. Otherwise those old bucket values take
precedence at inference and silently mask the new fit. Existing checkpoints still honor
intentional bucket-specific temperatures, falling back to the corresponding per-type value
when a bucket is absent; the runtime's temperature clamp is unchanged.

This fixes configuration persistence, not measured model accuracy or calibration quality.
The notebook's calibration samples come from its training items; evaluate on separate held-out
data before claiming an improvement. Already published checkpoints are not rewritten.
Run the CPU-only regression checks with `python tests/test_calibration_persistence.py`
(synthetic configs and tiny local fixtures; no pretrained downloads or training).

Fine-tuning is where most of the value is. On the typed-decisions benchmark the base
checkpoints score near chance zero-shot (0.36 and 0.35 against a 0.318 random baseline),
while the fine-tuned checkpoint reaches **0.766** on the same 2,000 decisions -- above
TypeSafe Jev's published 0.727 and above the 0.735 teacher self-agreement ceiling. Treat Laya
as a fast base to specialise, not as a zero-shot decision engine.

Runtime on 2xT4 is roughly 4-5 hours for 4 epochs over ~30k questions.

### Worked example: a browser-agent decision head

[`docs/finetune_browser_agent.md`](docs/finetune_browser_agent.md) records a complete specialisation
on a single 16 GB GPU with no paid API: Laya as the operation/target decider for
[browser-use/jev-ultrafast](https://github.com/browser-use/jev-ultrafast) (same request format as
TypeSafe Jev). Element top-1 among ~45 candidates goes from 0.10 zero-shot to 0.66, real-task
success from 0 % to 62 % at 17-23 ms per step; weights, pipeline code and per-run results are on
the Hub at [cklxx/laya-browser](https://huggingface.co/cklxx/laya-browser). The write-up covers the
data recipe (reverse-generated goals, executed DONE states, Mind2Web, on-policy corrections), the
input-format change that mattered most, and the things that did not work.
